**PiePie Google Companion**

<p>PiePie Launcher supports integrating the Google Now page into the desktop, like Pixel Launcher and Google Now Launcher, through the help of the PiePie Google Companion APK. Unfortunately the API from Google is restricted to just preinstalled (system) apps, such as the launcher that came with your device. Third party apps can only use it through a workaround of manually installing a "debuggable" APK outside of the Play Store.
